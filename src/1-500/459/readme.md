# 题目
Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

 

Example 1:

Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
Example 2:

Input: "aba"
Output: False
Example 3:

Input: "abcabcabcabc"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)

Consider a string S="helloworld". Now, given another string T="lloworldhe", can we figure out if T is a rotated version of S? Yes, we can! We check if S is a substring of T+T.

Fine. How do we apply that to this problem? We consider every rotation of string S such that it's rotated by k units [k < len(S)] to the left. Specifically, we're looking at strings "elloworldh", "lloworldhe", "loworldhel", etc...

If we have a string that is periodic (i.e. is made up of strings that are the same and repeat R times), then we can check if the string is equal to some rotation of itself, and if it is, then we know that the string is periodic. Checking if S is a sub-string of (S+S)[1:-1] basically checks if the string is present in a rotation of itself for all values of R such that 0 < R < len(S).
