# 377. Combination Sum IV
Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

```python
Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
 

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?


```

#Analysis
This is a dynamic programming problem: 
using a array to store the number of possible combination of the values from 1 to target
then the transition function would be like: dp[cur] += dp[cur - curNum]

#Source Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (i >= nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - nums[j]];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```
